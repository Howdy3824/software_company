# Semantic segmentation example

This directory contains a script, `run_semantic_segmentation_no_trainer.py`, that showcases how to fine-tune any model supported by the [`AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation` API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation) (such as [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/segformer), [BEiT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/beit), [DPT]((https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/dpt))) for semantic segmentation using PyTorch.

![segformer_inference_widget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48327001/163667406-01f323a6-72ec-4e7e-bdeb-7d9da71b0697.gif)

The script leverages [ðŸ¤— `Accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), which allows to write your own training loop in PyTorch, but have it run instantly on any (distributed) environment, including CPU, multi-CPU, GPU, multi-GPU and TPU. It also supports mixed precision. 

## Note on custom data

In case you'd like to use the script with custom data, there are 2 things required: 1) creating a DatasetDict 2) creating an id2label mapping. Below, these are explained in more detail.

### Creating a `DatasetDict`

The script assumes that you have a `DatasetDict` with 2 columns, "image" and "label", both of type [Image](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Image). This can be created as follows:

```python
from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict, Image

image_paths_train = ["path/to/image_1.jpg/png", "path/to/image_2.jpg/png", ..., "path/to/image_n.jpg/png"]
label_paths_train = ["path/to/annotation_1.png", "path/to/annotation_2.png", ..., "path/to/annotation_n.png"]

# same for validation
# image_paths_validation = [...]
# label_paths_validation = [...]

def create_dataset(image_paths, label_paths):
    dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"image": sorted(image_paths),
                                "label": sorted(label_paths)})
    dataset = dataset.cast_column("image", Image())
    dataset = dataset.cast_column("label", Image())
    
    return dataset

# step 1: create Dataset objects
train_dataset = create_dataset(image_paths_train, label_paths_train)
validation_dataset = create_dataset(image_paths_validation, label_paths_validation)

# step 2: create DatasetDict
dataset = DatasetDict({
    "train": train_dataset,
    "validation": val_dataset,
  }
)

# step 3: push to hub (assumes you have ran the huggingface-cli login command in a terminal/notebook)
dataset.push_to_hub("name of repo on the hub")

# optionally, you can push to a private repo on the hub
# dataset.push_to_hub("name of repo on the hub")
```

An example of such a dataset can be seen at [nielsr/ade20k-demo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nielsr/ade20k-demo).

### Creating an id2label mapping

Besides that, the script also assumes the existence of an `id2label.json` file in the repo, containing a mapping from integers to actual class names.
An example of that can be seen [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nielsr/ade20k-demo/blob/main/id2label.json). You can easily upload this by clicking on "Add file" in the "Files and versions" tab of your repo on the hub.

## Running the script

First, run:

```bash
accelerate config
```

and reply to the questions asked regarding the environment on which you'd like to train. Then

```bash
accelerate test
```

that will check everything is ready for training. Finally, you can launch training with

```bash
accelerate launch --output_dir segformer-finetuned-sidewalk --with_tracking --push_to_hub
```

and boom, you're training, possibly on multiple GPUs, logging everything to all trackers found in your environment (like Weights and Biases, Tensorboard) and regularly pushing your model to the hub (with the repo name being equal to `args.output_dir` at your HF username) ðŸ¤—

With the default settings, the script fine-tunes a [SegFormer]((https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/segformer)) model on the [segments/sidewalk-semantic](segments/sidewalk-semantic) dataset.

The resulting model can be seen here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/segformer-finetuned-sidewalk.

## Reload and perform inference

This means that after training, you can easily load your trained model as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation

model_name = "name_of_repo_on_the_hub_or_path_to_local_folder"

feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

and perform inference as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# prepare image for the model
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits

# rescale logits to original image size
logits = nn.functional.interpolate(outputs.logits.detach().cpu(),
                                    size=image.size[::-1], # (height, width)
                                    mode='bilinear',
                                    align_corners=False)

predicted = logits.argmax(1)
```

For visualization of the segmentation maps, we refer to the [example notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/SegFormer/Segformer_inference_notebook.ipynb).

## Important notes

Some datasets, like [`scene_parse_150`](scene_parse_150), contain a "background" label that is not part of the classes. The Scene Parse 150 dataset for instance contains labels between 0 and 150, with 0 being the background class, and 1 to 150 being actual class names (like "tree", "person", etc.). For these kind of datasets, one replaces the background label (0) by 255, which is the `ignore_index` of the PyTorch model's loss function, and reduces all labels by 1. This way, the `labels` are PyTorch tensors containing values between 0 and 149, and 255 for all background/padding.

In case you're training on such a dataset, make sure to set the ``reduce_labels`` flag, which will take care of this.
